<p>Audi has launched the eight generation A6 in India with fresh set of cosmetic and feature updates. The premium sedan is available in two trims – Premium Plus and Technology. The new model is underpinned by the parent company Volkswagen’s MLB platform.</p>
<p>
<b>Exterior </b>:
<br>
The exterior design on this new car is evolutionary but has moved from the rounded edges of the fourth generation A6 to a sharper and sportier design for this new car. We’ve taken a liking to the rather space age looking LED lighting package both in the front and rear and they do well to add to the car’s futuristic appearance.</p>
<p>
<b>Interior </b>:
<br>
The new Audi A6 is the first Audi in India to be offered with the dual touchscreen setup in the centre console. The upper screen runs Audi’s latest MMI system while the lower screen does duty for the climate control and other functions. The car is the same length as the fourth generation model but inside there is more room. The cabin length is up by 21 mm, rear legroom by 17 mm, and there's more headroom - 8mm in front and 11 mm at the rear.</p>
<p>
<b>Engine </b>  :
<br>
Under the hood, the Audi A6 is limited to a petrol engine. The car gets a BS-VI emission compliant 2.0-litre petrol in the 45TFSI guise. This engine produces 245bhp/370Nm and is mated to a seven-speed S-Tronic transmission sending power to the front wheels.
